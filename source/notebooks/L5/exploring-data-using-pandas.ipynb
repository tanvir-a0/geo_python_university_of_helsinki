We will focus on using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) which is an open-source package for data analysis in Python. pandas is an excellent toolkit for working with *real world data* that often have a tabular structure (rows and columns).\n",

    "- **pandas Series** (a 1-dimensional data structure) is used for storing and manipulating a sequence of values. pandas Series is kind of like a list, but more clever. One row or one column in a pandas DataFrame is actually a pandas Series. \n",

    "These pandas structures incorporate a number of things we've already encountered, such as indices, data stored in a collection, and data types. Let's have another look at the pandas data structures below with some additional annotation.\n",

In the lesson this week we'll use many of these features to explore real-world data and learn some useful data analysis procedures.\n",

There are several ways in which data can be read from a file in Python, and for several years now we have decided to focus primarily on pandas because it is easy-to-use, efficient and intuitive. If you are curoius about other approaches for interacting with data files, you can find lesson materials from previous years about reading data using [NumPy](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/2018.1/notebooks/L5/numpy/1-Exploring-data-using-numpy.html#Reading-a-data-file-with-NumPy) or [built-in Python functions](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/2017.1/lessons/L5/reading-data-from-file.html).\n",

In this case you should only read in the columns `YEARMODA` and `TEMP`, so the new variable `temp_data` should have 30 rows and 2 columns. You can achieve this using the `usecols` parameter when reading in the file.
